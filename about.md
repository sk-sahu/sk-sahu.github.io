I am currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] doing project in a Plant Developmental Biology lab with the area of research on Computational Genomics and Systems Biology. I have completed my M.Sc. degree in Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University] in 2017. For more information my [Linkedin Profile]

### Broadly area of research interest:
* I use data science platforms (R and Python) as a tool to answer biology.
* Use of High-Throughput Sequencing or NGS data and making sense out of it with relevant biological questions.
* I am optimistic about single-cell RNA-Seq.
* Passionate about complex networks and their behaviour.
* Developing web apps/tools for Biolgical community is my current favourite task. (check the project tab)

### Scientific contributions:
* Peer-Review on Scientific Jornals. [Publons profile](https://publons.com/a/1564864/)
* Bioinformatics Volunteer/Curator in Omictools platform. [Omictools profile](https://omictools.com/profile/sangram-github)

### Contact me
I will be happy to have a chat about all the buzz on the field of AI and Tech around alongside scientific discussions. You can directly reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sangram_ksahu).
