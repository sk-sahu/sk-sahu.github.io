### What do I work?
I'm a Computational Biologist by training and currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] in Plant Developmental Biology lab with the area of research in Genomics and Systems Biology. I received my M.Sc. Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University] in 2017. 

In most days, I use data science platforms as a medium to answer biological questions. I recently started developing web apps/tools for data visualisation and building comprehensive workflows for the ease of Biological community. I believe in more open science/ transparent research and try contribute to the best of my capabilities.
