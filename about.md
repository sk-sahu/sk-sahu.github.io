### What I work?
I'm a Computational Biologist, and currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] in Plant Developmental Biology lab with the area of research in Genomics and Systems Biology. I received my M.Sc. Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University] in 2017. 

In my most days, I mainly use data science platforms (In R and Python) as a medium to answer biological questions. Recently involved in developing web apps/tools for Biolgical community for data visualisation.

I belive in contributing to open science and transparent research and doing best to my capacities.
