I'm a Bioinformatics Research Engineer, helping understand Genomics data. Coming from Computational Biology research discipline I understand the complexity of biological data and responsible execution to extract insights in [FAIR] way. 

Currently working with teams around world to develop things around what I believe the most - **Democratize and Open access Research** (especially in Life Science domain), Before this I was a Research Fellow at [IISER, Mohali] in Plant Developmental Biology lab working with Gene Regulatory Networks in Arabidopsis.


### Research 

I use data science platforms as a medium to answer biological questions.

#### Broad areas of Research Interest
* Genomics and Systems Biology
* Single-cell Transcriptomics
* Application of Deep learning in Biology

### Engineering

I write web apps/tools for data Visualization and build comprehensive workflows for the ease of Biological community around [FAIR] principles.

#### Broad areas of Interest

* Scientific Workflows
* Interactive applications
* Data Visualization
