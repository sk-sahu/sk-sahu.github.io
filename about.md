Hi!
I am a graduate student in Bioinformatics from Pondicherry University, With research interests in Computational Genomics. That include study with High-throughput data analysis and pipeline design. For now, I mostly use Perl and R as the basic language to play with the data. Undoubtedly this is very exciting time for the field of Computational Biology, that we are living in.


### More Information
Currently doing as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at IISER, Mohali.
