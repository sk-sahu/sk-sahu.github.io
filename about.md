Hi! Thanks for your interest to visit. Here are few details me :)

I am currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] doing project in a Plant Developmental Biology lab with area of research on Computaional Genomics and Bioinformatics.

### Broadly area of research interest:
* High-Throughput Sequencing/NGS data and making sense out of it with relevant biological questions. I am optimistic with single-cell RNA-Seq.
* I use data science platforms (R and Python) as a tool to answer biology. 
* I am passionate about complex networks and their behaviour.
* Making rich visualization web apps/tools is my current favorite task.

#### Few more details

I have completed my M.Sc. degree in Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University], with thesis title "A transcriptomic study on cold stress in two Indian rice varieties using RNA-Seq analysis." An abstract of the work published on Canadian Journal of Biotechnology (You can read it [here.])

Further details on other projects can be find [here](https://sksahu.net/projects).
