Hi! I am Sangram.
Thank you for taking the time to visit my site :)

I am currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] doing a project in a Plant Developmental Biology lab with the area of research on Computational Genomics and Bioinformatics. I have completed my M.Sc. degree in Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University] in 2017.

### Broadly area of research interest:
* I use data science platforms (R and Python) as a tool to answer biology.
* High-Throughput Sequencing/NGS data and making sense out of it with relevant biological questions. I am optimistic with single-cell RNA-Seq.
* Passionate about complex networks and their behaviour.
* Making rich visualisation web apps/tools is my current favourite task.

### Scientific contributions:
* Review Scientific jornals. [Publons profile](https://publons.com/a/1564864/)
* Bioinformatics Volunteer at Omictools. [Omictools profile](https://omictools.com/profile/sangram-github)
* An active user on Biostar forum. [Biostar Profile](https://www.biostars.org/u/36693/)
