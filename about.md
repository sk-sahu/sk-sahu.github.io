I am currently a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) at [IISER, Mohali] doing project in Computaional Biology. I am interested in High-Throughput Sequencing/NGS data and making sense out of it with relevant biological questions. I use data science tools (with R and Python) as a medium to answer biology. Besides this, I am passionate about complex networks and their behaviour.

I have completed my M.Sc. degree in Bioinformatics from [BICPU], [Pondicherry University], with thesis work on Plant Transcriptome data. 

Further details on other projects can be find [here](https://sksahu.net/projects).
